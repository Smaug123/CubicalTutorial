# Cubical Agda Tutorial

This was written while I was getting up to speed with Cubical Agda.

# Quick start

## Installing Agda

If you already have Agda installed, great.
If not, follow the official instructions.
I use `brew install agda`.

## Installing cubical
There are install instructions at https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.1/language/cubical.html .
Only the paragraph "For detailed install instructions..." is necessary; it amounts to cloning the Cubical repo, building it, and adding it to ~/.agda/libraries and ~/.agda/defaults.

## Which file to start with

The first file is `File1.agda`.
Open it up in emacs (or your normal Agda editing environment) and follow it.
